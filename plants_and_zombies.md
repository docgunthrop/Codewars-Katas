<p>This kata is inspired by <a href="http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" style="color:#9f9;text-decoration:none"><b>Plants vs. Zombies</b></a>, a tower defense video game developed and originally published by PopCap Games.</p>

<p>The battlefield is the front lawn and the zombies are coming. Our defenses (consisting of pea-shooters) are in place and we've got the stats of each attacking zombie. Your job is to figure out how long it takes for them to penetrate our defenses.</p>

<h2 style='color:#f66'>Mechanics</h2>
<p>The two images below represent the lawn (for the test example below) at separate stages in the game.</br>
<b>Left:</b> state at move <code>3</code>, before shooters fire. <b>Right:</b>state at move <code>5</code>, after shooters fire. (Moves are <code>0</code>-based)</p>
<div style="background:#262729"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1wSbnMC.png" alt="example image"></div>
<ul>
	<li><strong style='color:#95c4ff'>Moves:</strong> During a move, new zombies appear and/or existing ones move forward one space to the left. Then the shooters fire. This two-step process repeats.</br>
	If a zombie reaches a shooter's position, it destroys that shooter. In the example image above, the zombie at <code>[4,4]</code> on the left reaches the shooter at <code>[4,2]</code> and destroys it. The zombie has <code>1</code> health point remaining and is eliminated in the same move by the shooter at <code>[4,0]</code>.</li>
	<li><strong style='color:#95c4ff'>Numbered shooters</strong> shoot straight (to the right) a given number of times per move. In the example image, the green numbered shooter at <code>[0,0]</code> fires <code>2</code> times per move.</li>
	<li><strong style='color:#95c4ff'>S-shooters</strong> shoot straight, and diagonally upward and downward (ie. three directions simultaneously) once per move. In the example image, the blue and orange S-shooters can attack zombies in any of the blue and orange squares, respectively (if not blocked by other zombies).</br>
	At move <code>3</code> the blue shooter can only hit the zombie at <code>[1,5]</code> while the orange shooter hits each of the zombies at <code>[1,5]</code>, <code>[2,7]</code>, and <code>[4,6]</code> once for that move.</li>
	<li><strong style='color:#95c4ff'>Shooting Priority</strong>: The numbered shooters fire all their shots in a cluster, then the S-shooters fire their shots in order from right to left, then top to bottom. Note that once a zombie's health reaches <code>0</code> it drops immediately and does not absorb any additional shooter pellets.</br>
	In the example image, the orange S-shooter fires before the blue one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style='color:#f66'>Input</h2>
<p>Your function will receive two arguments:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong style='color:#95c4ff'>Lawn Map:</strong> An array/list consisting of strings, where each string represents a row of the map. Each string will consist of either <code>" "</code> (space character) which represents empty space, a numeric digit (<code>0-9</code>) representing a numbered shooter, or the letter <code>S</code> representing an S-shooter.</li>
	<li><strong style='color:#95c4ff'>Zombie Stats:</strong> An array of subarrays representing each zombie, in the following format:</br>
	<code>[i,row,hp]</code> - where <code>i</code> is the move number (0-based) when it appears, <code>row</code> is the row the zombie walks down, and <code>hp</code> is the initial health point value of the zombie.</br>
	When new zombies appear, they start at the farthest right column of their row.</li>
</ul>
<p>Input will always be valid.</p>

<h2 style='color:#f66'>Output</h2>
<p>Return the number of moves before the first zombie penetrates our defenses (by getting past column <code>0</code>), or <code>null</code>/<code>None</code> if all zombies are eliminated.</p>

<h2 style='color:#f66'>Test Example</h2>

```javascript
let lawn = [
	'2       ',
	'  S     ',
	'21  S   ',
	'13      ',
	'2 3     '
];
let zombies = [[0,4,28],[1,1,6],[2,0,10],[2,4,15],[3,2,16],[3,3,13]];
plantsAndZombies(lawn,zombies); //10
```
```python
lawn = [
	'2       ',
	'  S     ',
	'21  S   ',
	'13      ',
	'2 3     '
]
zombies = [[0,4,28],[1,1,6],[2,0,10],[2,4,15],[3,2,16],[3,3,13]]
plants_and_zombies(lawn,zombies); #10
```
